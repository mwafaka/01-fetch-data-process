# Fetch and Process Data from an API

## Description
You are required to complete the following assignment that involves fetching data from an API and processing it using JavaScript. Follow the instructions below to complete the task.

## Instructions
1. Write a JavaScript function named `fetchData` that is declared as an `async` function.
2. Inside the `fetchData` function, use the `try-catch` statement to handle any errors that may occur during the data fetching process.
3. Within the `try` block, use the `fetch` function to make a GET request to the "https://api.example.com/data" endpoint.
4. Assign the returned response to a constant named `response`.
5. Use the `response.json()` method to extract the JSON data from the response.
6. Assign the extracted data to a constant named `data`.
7. Print the `data` to the console using `console.log(data)`.
8. Inside the `catch` block, log any errors to the console using `console.error(error)`.
9. Call the `fetchData` function outside the function declaration to initiate the data fetching process.
